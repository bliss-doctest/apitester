# How to contribute

The community is essential to spread the bliss of development. We improve our open source libraries as far as we need to use them in our projects. But we can't think of all the use cases you might have. So we'd like to have you participating in our bliss. We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes. There are just a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.

## Writing issues

* Submit a new ticket for your issue, assuming [one does not already exist](https://github.com/devbliss/apitester/issues/new).
* Clearly describe the issue including, in the case of bugs, steps to reproduce it.

## Making Changes

* [Fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) into your own github account
* Create a local copy of this repository on your machine. `git clone git@github.com:{your_username}/apitester.git`
* Create a topic branch on which you want to base your work. `git checkout -b {branchname}`
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that branch.
  * Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units. `git add {file}; git commit -m "{commit message}"`
* Make sure your commit messages are informative.
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Run _all_ the tests to ensure nothing else was broken accidentally. `mvn test`
* Add your contribution information
  * Add your name and email to the contributors section in the pom.xml
  * If you added new files make sure you added your name to it with the author tag `@author`
  * If you added new files make sure you added a license of your choice to that file.

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to the topic branch in your fork of the repository. `git push origin {branchname}`
* Submit a pull request to the repository in the devbliss organization. [see this link](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)
* Write an informative pull request description.
* Please don't add information to changes.md`.
